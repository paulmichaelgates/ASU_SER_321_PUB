#How to use

each folder containing code files is encapsulated in its own module, that is, in order to compile
the code to see results, simply use 'javac FileName.java' where FileName is the name of the java
source file containing the main method (some may have multiple files, but only one will have a
main function). Then simply run using 'java FileName' (remove .java extension)
